How does js make websites more interactive?
	access content-you can use js to select any element, attribute or text in HTML
	modify content-you can use js to add/remove any element, attribute or text to the page 
	program rules-specify a set of steps for the browser to follow
	react to events-can specify when a script is run based on what the person using the page does ie: click a link, button is pressed, etc.

What is a script?
	set of instructions that computer will follow to scheme a goal. Think like a manual or recipe. A set of instructions is placed for you to follow. Only you are giving instructions to a computer. 

What are the steps to write a script?
	define a goal-define what task you want to achieve
	design the script-split the goal using a serious of tasks, kind of like a receipt for the computer to follow. You can use a flowchart to help. Flowchart example on p.18
	code each step-needs to be written in a language that the computer understands ie: js

What is an expression?
	expression puts a result into a single value
		
Can expressions use more than one value?
	Yes, it can assign a value to a variable ie: var color = ‘beige’;
	or it can use 2 or more values to show a single value ie: = var area = 3 * 2; single value is 6.

What are operators?
	things that expressions rely on. Programmers use operators to make a single value from 	one or more values.

What are 3 types of operators discussed in this section?
	assignment operators-they assign a value to a variable ie: color = ‘beige’
	arithmetic operators-perform basic math ie: area = 3 * 2;
	string operators-combine 2 strings ie: greeting = ‘Hi ’ + ‘Molly’ There is only ONE string operator and that is the + symbol. It joins the string on either side of it. ie: Hi Molly

See chart on page 76 to see chart of mathematical operators. *order of execution is important*

What is a function declaration?
	creating a function. First you would use the keyword, function. Then you would give your function a name, it is simple and use camel case. ie: function sayHello (). Then you would put the statements needed to run the task in the curly brackets.

What does “calling the function” mean?
	executing all of the statements between the curly brackets with just one line.  From the earlier example, if I wanted to use that function I would just put sayHello();

What would happen if the function needs information to continue?
	You would need to give it parameters. Parameters are like variables but need to be provided. 
	If a function needs information to work you would put that in the parentheses after the function name. Ie: function getArea (width, height)
	When you call a function that has parameters you will need to specify the parameters, ie: getArea(3, 5); the three meaning width and the five meaning height. 
	when the function performs a calculation, they will return the result.
