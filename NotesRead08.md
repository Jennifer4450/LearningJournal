You can evaluate a situation by evaluating conditions. The result will be boolean (True or False)
== (means is equal to) it compares 2 values to see if they are the same. ie: ‘Hello’ == ‘Goodbye’ will return false because they are not the same. ‘Hello’ == ‘Hello’ will return true because they are the same. 
!= (means is not equal to) it compares 2 values to see if they are not the same. ie: ‘Hello’ != ‘Goodbye’ will return true because they are not the same. ‘Hello’ != ‘Hello’ will return false because they are the same. 
=== (means strict equal to) compares 2 values to check that both the data type and value are the same. ie: ‘3’ === 3 is not the same data type so that will return false. ‘3’ === ‘3’ is the same data type so that will return true. 
!== (means strict not equal to) compares 2 values to check that both the data type and value are the not same. ie: ‘3’ !== 3 is not the same data type so that will return true. ‘3’ !== ‘3’ is the same data type so that will return false. 
> (greater than), < (less than), >=(greater than or equal to), <=(less than or equal to)
Logical operators-allow you to compare results of more than one expression.
&& (logical and)
||  (logical or)
! (logical not)
