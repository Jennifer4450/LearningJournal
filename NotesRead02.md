Article: _Choosing a text editor_

### What is a text editor?  
>software that is downloaded and installed on your computer that helps you manage the text that you will be using to code.  

### What are some important features to look for?  

- code completion: this allows you to start typing and display possible suggestions.  Similar to searching on Google. This saves time and reduces typos.  Some features will automatically put closing brackets to reduce errors. 

- syntax highlighting: this feature takes the text and makes it a different color so it is more noticeable.  For example, attributes, elements and copy are different colors.  This makes it eaiser to read, eaiser to find errors and **reduces eye strain.**

- themes: this allows you to change the color of the background and colors of your text. To **reduce eye strain** a dark bacground with colored text is used. 

- extensions: additional features that can be used with your text editor. These are basically "plug ins" for the specific text editor you are using.  As you find yourself becoming more familiar with code, extensions will allow for growth as a coder and you can add functions when you need them. 

### The software on your computer usually has a text editor.  Why download another one?

- text editors that come on your computer are _VERY_ basic. Other text editors may have better functions to meet your coding needs.
