### All about Me

My name is Jennifer Smith. I was born and raised in Iowa and am a new coding student. I currently work as a Sign Language interpreter but have become stagnant in my field and became interested in coding. I have no previous coding experience but am excited to go full force into this new experience and hope to make it a new career.  I could go on with my other interests but decided to go with a fun fact instead. 

*fun fact number 1*  Ever seen the movie *Frozen*? There is a song in there titled *Reindeers are Better Than People*.  I recently discovered my youngest son hates that song. I decided to use it as a tool to get him to listen. Every time he doesnt follow directions I start singing that song.  He quiets down and does whatever I ask without me having to yell or discipline him. WIN! He especially hates it when I do it in public. 


### Growth Mindset 

Everytime I think of growth mindset I always think of the movie *Meet The Robinsons*. There is a line in the movie that always helps me look a different way at the thought of making a mistake *"Failure you learn, success not so much"*. When using this mantra I feel better about my potential and use that to continue to learn and grow. When you feel better about your own potential you also want to see others acheive more. That sets up positivity and potential for your team! Everybody wins!

### Reminders I can use to help me keep my Growth Mindset
- Everyone has to start somewhere
- Your learning process is not the same as everyone else
- Don't be afraid of challenges, if you fail, that's ok because tha's how you learn!
