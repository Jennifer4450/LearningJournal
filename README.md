### Growth Mindset 

Everytime I think of growth mindset I always think of the movie *Meet The Robinsons*. There is a line in the movie that always helps me look a different way at the thought of making a mistake *"Failure you learn, success not so much"*. When using this mantra I feel better about my potential and use that to continue to learn and grow. When you feel better about your own potential you also want to see others acheive more. That sets up positivity and potential for your team! Everybody wins!

### Reminders I can use to help me keep my Growth Mindset
- Everyone has to start somewhere
- Your learning process is not the same as everyone else
- Don't be afraid of challenges, if you fail, that's ok because tha's how you learn!

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
